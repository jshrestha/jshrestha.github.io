---

Cloud computing sounds like an invention dreamed up in a marketing meeting, but it is real and in use today by millions of people. You many not be aware that you are using it, but it is highly likely that you are in many more ways than you think. The easiest way to think about cloud computing is to consider it as an application that does not sit on your computer, but on the internet instead.
The fact that the information is remote offers many advantages because this makes it available to variety of devices, including desktops, smartphones and tablets, and they can all be kept in sync all of the time. Clouds can be public and accessible by anyone or they can be set up by companies for secure private use with the ability to distribute information and software remotely.
The speed of modern mobile and fixed networks has enabled these facilities to become reality and you really do forget that you are using the internet to connect to your data. It almost feels magical how all of your information is seamlessly available on all of your devices whenever you need it and the cloud is without doubt going to be the future of all computing.

### Cloud Security
Security is always a prime concern when using any cloud service. Always check the company providing the service and be sure to only store data online that you are comfortable with.

### Compatibility
Not all cloud services are compatible with every device. Some are designed for a single manufacturer’s products, so do your research to ensure that the services will work.

### Back up
Check to ensure that your data is available to backup should you want to do so. The larger cloud services are extremely reliable, but you should still keep a locally held backup.

### Offline
Some services offer offline functionality – ideal for those times when you have no internet access. This ensures that you can work and play 24 hours a day, every day.

### Core data
Always be aware of where your ‘core’ data is held. Almost every service will offer a URL or location that you can view to check the default data.
