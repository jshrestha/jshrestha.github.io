title: My Experience at Bloc
---
My experience with Bloc right now had been a great one. I came into Bloc with very little coding experience and I have so far learned quite a bit of basic JavaScript. I would definitely recommend Bloc. Generally speaking, the material is well written and I enjoyed the mentorship. They help you keep the wheels turning. Bloc hosts webcasts on a variety of topics and provides additional resources to supplement your learning.Â 
The program pace is not even throughout the program. Sometimes, it'll take longer than you expect to complete a task, while other days you'll feel like a champion. I have learned a lot by asking questions. Whether you direct them towards your mentor, other Bloc students in the slack channel or facebook group, or people you connect with outside the program, it's quite helpful. And don't be afraid to return the favor. It will solidify your understanding.
What I have learnt from the Bloc program is that he only way to develop a comprehensive understanding of coding is by first building a foundational knowledge of how and why programming does certain things. A failure to understand the basic building blocks will limit your comprehension down the road.
